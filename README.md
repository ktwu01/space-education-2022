# Space Physics Practical Education Project

This project documents my first-authored and corresponding-authored review on space physics hands-on education, published in *Reviews of Geophysics and Planetary Physics*.

## Project Highlights

**Core Problem Addressed**: Traditional space physics education lacked practical components, creating a disconnect between theoretical knowledge and actual research work, hindering student engagement with real scientific workflows.

**Technical Strategies & Implementation**:
- **Multi-source Data Integration**: Synthesized NASA STEREO, GOES satellite datasets with Chinese Meridian Project ground-based observation networks
- **Cross-platform Analysis Framework**: Deployed MATLAB, Python, IDL for comprehensive data processing and visualization pipelines
- **Advanced Instrumentation**: Operated meteor radar, incoherent scatter radar, sodium LiDAR, and space plasma simulation systems

**Project Impact**:
- Established comprehensive practical education framework benefiting 480+ undergraduate students
- Successfully analyzed major space weather events including 2022 "Starlink" geomagnetic storm
- Created replicable educational model for space science talent development

**Tech Stack**: MATLAB, Python, IDL, Multi-satellite Data Processing, Ground-based Observation Analysis
